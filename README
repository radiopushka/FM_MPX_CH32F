THIS CODE MIGHT WORKS AND HAS BEEN TESTED!
WORKS BETTER THAN MOST CHINESE FM CHIPS WHEN IT COMES TO AUDIO.
MICROCONTROLLER: CH32V307
CLOCK: 144 MHZ
DAC OUTPUT (TO MPX INPUT ON TRANSMITTER): PA4
LEFT -PA1
RIGHT- PA0


3.3v -> 3.5k resistor -> PA0 -> 500 ohms ->GND
PA0->4.7uF capacitor -> Right channel

3.3v -> 3.5k resistor -> PA1 -> 500 ohms ->GND
PA1->4.7uF capacitor -> Left channel
