THIS CODE WORKS AND HAS BEEN TESTED!
WORKS BETTER THAN MOST CHINESE FM CHIPS WHEN IT COMES TO AUDIO.
MICROCONTROLLER: CH32V307
CLOCK: 144 MHZ
DAC OUTPUT (TO MPX INPUT ON TRANSMITTER): PA4
LEFT -PA1
RIGHT- PA0


3.3v -> in4007-> 1k-470R resistor -> PA0 -> 1k-470R resistor -> in4007 ->GND
PA0->47uF capacitor -> Right channel

3.3v -> in4007-> 1k-470R resistor -> PA1 -> 1k-470R resistor -> in4007 ->GND
PA1->47uF capacitor -> Left channel

PA4 can go straight to the MPX input on your transmitter. You might need an amplifier but that depends on your transmitter, most likely you will need a variable resistor since PLL VCOs are very sensitive usually.

IN CASE YOUR AUDIO IS VERY GRAINY AND NOT CLEAR, PUT A 15 NF CAPACITOR BETWEEN PA4 AND GROUND, THEN RE ADJUST THE VOLUME
